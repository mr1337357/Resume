# resume
[Current latest resume](https://github.com/mr1337357/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf)\
Compile with lualatex\
I made this from a template I found on the internet so feel free to delet my personal data and put in your own. :)
## Notes
I had to run these commands on ubuntu to get lua working:\
    `sudo apt install texlive-latex-base`\
    `sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra`\
    `sudo apt install texlive-luatex`

To generate the resume run:\
    `lualatex resume.tex`
